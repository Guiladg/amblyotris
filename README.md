# Amblyotris

This is a version of Tetris made for people with amblyopia who need to train the "lazy eye".

The code is partially based on Parzibyte's tutorial (https://parzibyte.me/blog/2020/11/02/tetris-javascript-open-source/) with many improvements and changes, part of them inspired by Tetr.js (https://github.com/simonlc/tetr.js). Thanks a lot for your work!

**Online game**: https://dresiribarren.com.ar/games/amblyotris/

The game is coded in TypeScript language and must be transpiled into JavaScript before being deployed to a web server. After running build script, the /build directory has all the files needed.
